### Hi there 👋

I'm Anteneh. I work as a full-time software developer. In my spare time I do open-sourcing (normally it is about 1-2 hours in the morning before the work).

The majority of my open-source rocket projects listed below 👇🏻 are focused on one thing - to help people how to tackle problems in real life. You may use these projects to learn about how to develop algorithms that can solve your problem and start experimenting with machine learning algorithms and math behind them, etc.
I also write memo articles about technologies.

Currently, developing the ✍🏻 axis.app online ride sharing app.
